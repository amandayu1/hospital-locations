# HEALTH TECH

Health Tech is a web app made for Hack the North 2021 hackathon.

The problem
Our society is becoming increasingly more dependent on technology, and thus, the use and accessibility of commonly used devices for individuals who have visual or auditory impairment becomes increasingly important. Our goal is to develop a solution that allows this minority group to communicate more conveniently, helping them fully participate and engage in society.

Our solution
Visual Speech is a web app that allows visually impaired users to connect to hearing impaired users. Voice messages sent by visually impaired users are received as text messages by hearing impaired users, allowing for seamless communication.

STACK
Node.js and Express for backend
Firestore (Firebase) for storing messages and audio buffers
React in frontend
Google cloud services: Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text
